**KNU-Mamba** is a PyTorch-based implementation of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) architecture, developed and maintained by the **Kyungpook National University (KNU)**.

This repository serves as a codebase for exploring efficient sequence modeling using Mamba, capable of handling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity.

> **Note**: This project builds upon the original Mamba architecture proposed by Gu & Dao (2023).

## 🚀 Feature

- **Efficient Implementation**: optimized for fast training and inference on GPUs.
- **Modular Design**: Easy integration into existing deep learning pipelines (e.g., for Computer Vision, NLP, or Time-Series analysis).
- **Research Ready**: Structured for experimentation with different state-space configurations.

## 🛠️ Installation
